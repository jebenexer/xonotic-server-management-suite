Installation
============

Install with setuptools::

   python3 setup.py install  # this clones the server configs and modpack
   xsms smbmod init          # setup SMB modpack and assets (optional)

If using docker, all custom server assets go in `~/.xonotic-smb` on the host
which gets mounted to `~/.xonotic` in the containers.
